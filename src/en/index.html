<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I hold over 10 years of experience developping web sites and APISs.
  I've worked for organizations of all size, helping them establish their presence online.</p>
<p>As a programmer, I want to put that experience to use collaborating with community orgs in Montréal/Tio'tia:ke.
  I'm prioritizing projects that revolve around the city's ballroom, burelesque and drag scenes,
  along with community-care projects, and queer, feminist, disabled and neurodivergent spaces.</p>
<p>I want to help us build the tools we need to march toward social justice, respond to the climate emergency,
  and promote active/public transit, public health and access to affordable housing.</p>
