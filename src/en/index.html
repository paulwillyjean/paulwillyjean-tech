    <h1 class="display-1">Hi, I'm Paul.</h1>
    <p>I’m a Black queer web developer based in Tiohtià:ke (Montréal).
      My work is grounded in community, in cooperation, and in building digital spaces that feel accessible, sustainable, and rooted in care.
      I believe technology should serve people, not the other way around, and I bring that commitment into every project I take on.</p>
    <p>I stand in solidarity with First Nations, with Haiti, with Palestine, with Ukraine,
      and with all movements working toward justice and liberation. For me, web development is about creating tools
      that help communities connect, organize, and imagine better futures together.</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
        I hope you find this space reflective of the values and commitments I bring to my work.
        If you are interested in collaborating, or simply want to connect and share ideas, I welcome you to reach out.</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I bring more than ten years of experience developing websites and APIs,
  supporting organizations of many different sizes as they establish their presence online.
  I build tools that are functional, creative, and grounded in the belief that technology can strengthen the communities it serves.</p>
<p>My focus now is on Tiohtià:ke and the communities that make this city alive.
  I want my skills to support spaces that matter to me, including ballroom, burlesque, and drag,
  as well as community-care projects and queer, feminist, disabled, and neurodivergent spaces.
  These communities create joy, resist oppression, and imagine new ways of living,
  and I see web development as a way to sustain their work.</p>
<p>I want to help build digital tools that contribute to a more just and liveable future.
  This includes supporting social justice movements, responding to the climate emergency,
  promoting active and public transit, advancing public health, and defending access to affordable housing.
  I believe web development is part of a larger commitment to collective survival and to creating
  conditions where communities can thrive.</p>
